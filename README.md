# Energy Consumption Prediction

Welcome to the *Energy Consumption Prediction* project! This repository is dedicated to developing and implementing machine learning models to forecast energy consumption in various contexts. Our goal is to create accurate and efficient predictions that can help in energy management, sustainability efforts, and cost reduction.

## Introduction

In an era of increasing energy demands and environmental concerns, accurate energy consumption prediction is crucial. This project leverages historical data, weather forecasts, and other relevant factors to build predictive models. These models can assist in optimizing energy usage, improving grid stability, and fostering sustainable practices.

We employ a variety of machine learning techniques, including *Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, to ensure robust and reliable predictions. Our approach includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation* to achieve high accuracy and generalization.
